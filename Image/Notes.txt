Digital Image-

A digital image is a representation of a real image as a set of numbers that can be stored and 
handled by a digital computer. In order to translate the image into numbers, it is divided into 
small areas called pixels (picture elements). For each pixel, the imaging device records a number,
 or a small set of numbers, that describe some property of this pixel, such as its brightness 
 (the intensity of the light) or its color. The numbers are arranged in an array of rows and columns 
 that correspond to the vertical and horizontal positions of the pixels in the image.

The color depth (of a color image) or "bits per pixel" is the number of bits in the numbers that
 describe the brightness or the color. More bits make it possible to record more shades of gray or
  more colors. For example, an RGB image with 8 bits per color has a total of 24 bits per pixel
   ("true color"). 

The format of the image gives more details about how the numbers are arranged in the image file,
 including what kind of compression is used, if any. Among the most popular of the dozens of formats 
 available are TIFF, GIF, JPEG, PNG, and Post-Script.

The Pillow library enables you to convert images between different pixel representations using the convert() method. 
It supports conversions between L (greyscale), RGB and CMYK modes.
